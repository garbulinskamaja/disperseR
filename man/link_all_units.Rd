\usage{
link_all_units(units.run, link.to = "zips", mc.cores = detectCores(),
  year.mons = NULL, start.date = NULL, end.date = NULL,
  pbl.height = pblheight, crosswalk. = NULL, counties. = NULL,
  duration.run.hours = 240, res.link = 12000, overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{units.run}{information on unit locations as output from disperseR::units()}

\item{link.to}{one of 'zips', 'counties', or 'grids' to denote spatial linkage scale. zips and counties are only for the USA}

\item{mc.cores}{`link_all_units()` enables the parallel run by default splitting different months on different cores, but you can make it serial just by setting the `mc.cores` argument to `1`.As mentioned before  `link_all_units()` enables the parallel run by default splitting different months on different cores, but you can make it serial just by setting the `mc.cores` argument to `1`.}

\item{year.mons}{these are the months for which we would like to do the linking. You can use the get_yearmon() function to create a vector that can be an input here.}

\item{start.date}{this argument is not necessary, but can be used if the user is interested in specifying a specific date to start the analysis with as opposed to using months. For example `start.date="2005-01-02"` for 2 January 2005. This argument are set to `NULL` by default and the function computes the start and the end dates using the `year.mons` provided.}

\item{pbl.height}{`pbl.height = pblheight` by default but you can change it. See the vignette}

\item{crosswalk.}{`crosswalk. = crosswalk` by default but you can change it. See the vignette}

\item{duration.run.hours}{`duration.run.hours = 240` by default which equals 10 days. 10 days is the maximum (approximately) that sulfur stays in the atmosphere before it deposits to the ground.}

\item{res.link}{Defines the grid resolution (in meters---defaults to 12000m = 12km) for linking. This is important for all link.to values, since parcel locations are first put on this grid before spatially allocating to other spatial domains.}

\item{overwrite}{`overwrite = FALSE` by default. Would you like to overwrite files that already exist?}

\item{end.date}{this argument is not necessary, but can be used if the user is interested in specifying a specific date to end the analysis with as opposed to using months. For example `start.date="2005-01-02"` for 2 January 2005.This argument are set to `NULL` by default and the function computes the start and the end dates using the `year.mons` provided.}

\description{
with `link_all_units()` users can link all air parcels to relevant spatial scales by month for specified units with combinations of years and months. `link_all_units()` reads in all the relevant HYSPLIT files (i.e., those that correspond to the provided units) produced by the `run_disperser_parallel()` function and saves them. Then it links them to relevant spatial scales.
